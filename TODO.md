# TODO

## In Development
This project is currently in development. Future updates, should they exist, will include enhancements to the existing features, as well as the addition of new capabilities.

## Top Priority
- added sha to file name to detect diff in files.  Make sure this correlates to some actual file difference and not some repo / tree diff.
  - [ ] compare sha's in gh to blob contents sha to ensure actual file differences are being saved.
  
- [ ] Improve error handling and logging.
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual functions.

## Features
- [ ] Add support for more file formats. Look into better and more consistent conversion. Is this necessary? Langchain??
- [ ] Add support for fetching and displaying repository statistics
- [ ] Create a more robust configuration system for user inputs.
    - work out include / exclude params scheme
## Bugs
- [ ] Resolve issue with large repository lists

## Improvements
- [ ] Rectify repository structure differences for forks and actual repo_info.

## Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new features
- [ ] Add usage examples to README
